[Zettelkasten - The Minimalist Approach - Step 1 - Read with a Card](https://youtu.be/M_-wE5wpjdU?si=il8gJkRjxIOqzurn), [Kathleen Spracklen](/People/p.spracklen-kathleen.md)

Purpose: As a polymath and student, I want to learning how to implement zettelkasten in the simplest way possible so that I can catalogue and retrieve information as I learn it without being loaded down by an overcomplicated system.
